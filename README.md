The dashboard consists of three primary visualizations to analyze sales data effectively. A **line chart** visualizes the count of sales over time, tracking trends using the order date. The **donut chart** highlights the distribution of sales by category, showing contributions from Office Supplies, Technology, and Furniture. The **bar chart** compares profit across regions, providing a clear view of regional performance. Additionally, interactive slicers for **Category** and **Region** allow flexible data filtering, making the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly. The combination of these elements ensures a comprehensive understanding of sales performance.
